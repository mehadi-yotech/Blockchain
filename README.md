# Day (1-2)


## Identifying project requirement
1. To develop a new cryptocurrency system (a new currency which value will be backed by the company's share/valuation). [mining/initial coin offering].
2. A cryptocurrency wallet for transactions.
3. Outlining the technical framework objectives and implementation strategy in a whitepaper.
4. Enabling exchange with other coins/tokens.

## Identify the use case first
Based on the use case choose an appropritate blockchain platform
Consensus Mechanism selection (PoW/PoS/PoA) [Ethereum is moving from PoW to PoS]
Designing the internal blockchain architecture (Public/Private Network, Transaction Validation, Key Management, etc).
Develop the system.


## Should we choose Coin or Token?
Coin: (BTC, ETH, LTC) - Coin operates on independent blockchain (Blockchain, Ethereum). They function as a medium of exchange, stores value and pays gas cost to its own network. But the development process requries to build from scratch, a complex process (using languages like go, rust, c++, python). And the security is depends on own mechanisms-(PoW/PoS).
Token: There are mainly two types of token utility and security. Utility token is used for accessing services or products whereas security tokens represents ownership in an asset using smart contracts. 
Security token: Its value is related to the valuatoin of the company. Basically they are contracts representing the share of the company. Security tokens are required to follow federal rules. In security token system, assets are fractionalized into a number of tokens. Through tokenization, asset ownership is transferred to a blockchain and assigned a unique alphanumeric sequence generated by hasing algorithm.
e.g. company's valuation is $20 million, and if we create 500 million token, each token will worth $0.4 in value.
Security tokens requires conducting Security Token Offering (STO):
- SEC register
- Compliance
- Legal Works

## Risks in security token:
- Misappropriation of funds
- Security Breaches
- If value fluctuates, it might hamper user's trust

## Is there any alternative?
Probably Security toke with reward or loyalty service might work, or governance token for decision making or stable coins.

## RWA tokenization (security tokens):
- Asset valuation
- Legal framework [ownership rights, regulatory compliance, and legal entity that holds the asset]
- smart contract [platform, token standards]
- tokenizing an asset is basically converting its ownership rights into blockchain-based digital tokens that are legally and technically enforceable

So basically depending on the valuation of the company security tokens will be created. Each tokens value will rely on the company's share, valuation or any other means of value. In that case the company must be trasparent about their products/work/share/etc to build the trust among users. Allowing token exchage in wallet's or other platform may also help. So far, security tokens seems to be a good option despite some legal challenges. These security tokens are built on top of existing reputable blockchain with standard protocols (ERC20, ERC1400, etc.) rather than building our own cryptocurrency network and coin. This is primarily because the public blockchains are heavily tested on security and infrastracture of its host chain. This is more reliable than new unproven system as new chains are vulnerable to privacy risks. Also it will reduce the complexity, time, cost and security risks. Using an existing token standards will make it easier for token interchangeability. 


# Day-3

Choosing the right metodology:
Agile will be most suitable approach to manage the project. Instead of trying to build the entire project at once, we can work on the fundamental task first like building the token payment functionality, test it with a small user group, and then subsequently work on other task.

Initial Plan:
- Collecting general information: an overview of the project.
- Project goals and objectives. What is the expected outcome? What are we trying to build?
- Project boundaries (legal works, financial, feasibility of the project)
- Identifying potential risks to come up with the solution.
- What and how am I going to deliver my daily output?
- Are we going to use any project management tool, like Jira, Trello or kanban board for tracking workflow?
- What about strctured documentations. [Confluence, Document360]


Q: How to choose the optimal legal jurisdiction for your Security Token Offering (STO), as regulations vary globally.
Q: Which Token Standard is suitable in our case ERC-20, ERC-1400 or ERC-3643 ?
Q: Security Token Offering (STO)
Q: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidelines
Q: Mint/Issuance of token ? [Pre-STO minting, As-needed minting]


The technical requirements for security tokens primarily involve the use of specialized smart contract standards that embed regulatory compliance rules directly into the code. Unlike basic tokens, security tokens must be programmable to ensure adherence to financial laws and investor protections across different jurisdictions.

Token Standards
ERC-20 - A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies.
ERC-721 - A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, like a deed for artwork or a song.
ERC-1155 - allows for more efficient trades and bundling of transactions – thus saving costs. This token standard allows for creating both utility tokens (such as $BNB or $BAT) and Non-Fungible Tokens like CryptoPunks.

ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Coments 20)
Token standard allows developers to build token applications that are interoperable with other products and servies. Token standards defines how tokens behave and interact across the Ethereum ecosystem. ERC-20 standard is used to provide additional funcionality to ether. ERC-20 uses Fungible Tokens (token against property where each token is exactly the same, both in terms of type and value, as another token. ERC-20 implements an API for tokens within Smart Contracts.
As of 06/20/2024 at least $83,656,418 worth of ERC-20 tokens were lost due to token reception issue. Note that a pure ERC-20 implementation is prone to this problem unless you implement a set of additional restrictions on top of the standard as listed below.
When ERC-20 tokens are sent to a smart contract that is not designed to handle ERC-20 tokens, those tokens can be permanently lost. This happens because the receiving contract does not have the functionality to recognize or respond to the incoming tokens, and there’s no mechanism in the ERC-20 standard to notify the receiving contract about the incoming tokens.
https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/

ERC-223
The main difference of ERC-223 with ERC-20 is that ERC-223 defines not only the token API but also the logic for transferring tokens from sender to recipient. It basically addresses some limitations of ERC-20 and introduces a new method of interaction between the token contract and a contract that may receive the tokens. Here, Recipients can detect that an ERC-223 token is being deposited. If a user sends ERC-223 tokens to a contract not supposed to receive tokens, the contract can reject the transaction, preventing token loss. ERC-223 tokens can include metadata, allowing arbitrary information to be attached to token transactions.
ERC-223 has it's own limitations:
- ERC-223 is not yet widely adopted, which may limit its compatibility with existing platforms
- ERC-223 is not backward compatible with ERC-20, existing ERC-20 contracts and tools will not work with ERC-223 tokens without modifications
- additional checks and functionalities in ERC-223 transfers may result in higher gas costs compared to ERC-20
https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-223/

ERC-1363
It's an extension interface for ERC-20 tokens. It supports executing custom logic on a recipient contract after transfers, or on a spender contract after approvals, all within a single transaction. It provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party, and then make a callback on the receiver or spender contract.


ERC-1400
ERC-1400 addresses the need for a standardized approach to issuing, managing, and transferring security tokens, while providing customizable regulatory enforcement, integrating global jurisdictional laws, and facilitating the incorporation of off-chain data into transactions for real-world validation and authorization. It allows for features like restricted transfers, partitioned balances, and the management of associated legal documents (off-chain validation of certificates)
ERC-1400 is a compelling solution for enterprises seeking to tokenize assets while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and maintaining security. Its versatility and robust features make it suitable for various use cases within different industries. Some relevant use cases for ERC-1400 are: Tokenized Securities, Real estate tokenization, Asset-backed tokenization, Private equity tokens, Supply chain finance, Intellectual Property Rights, Tokenized Funds.

T-REX ERC-3643
The  tokenized securities, or security tokens cannot be permissionless tokens like utility tokens, which can be transferred to anyone. They must be permissioned tokens in order to track ownership and make sure that only eligible investors can hold tokens, in order to comply with securities laws such as KYC, AML. T-REX ensures that an investor cannot become a holder of any digital securities without fulfilling all compliance requirements. Also, regulators can audit these smart contracts to verify an issuer's compliance, contributing towards a secure, transparent, and efficient system for managing security tokens.  ERC3643 tokens maintain full compatibility with all ERC-20.
The management of compliant transactions through T-REX backed permissioned tokens depends on 4 main pillers which allow issuers  allow issuers to use a decentralized Validator to control transfers and enforce compliance on the holders of the security token:
- ONCHAINID : a blockchain based identity management system, allowing for the creation of a globally accessible identity for every stakeholder.
- A set of validation certificate (verifiable credentials) : emitted by trusted thrid parties and signed on-chain, each of them linked to a single ONCHAINED.
- An Eligibility Verification System (EVS): to filter transactions based on issuer rules, and compliance rules ensuring adherence to offering regulations.
- A set of Compliance Rules (e.g. offering rules): 
Two main types of control requriement associated with the issuance, holding, and transfer of security tokens:
1. General Regulatory Controls : Universal laws that apply to all securities, regardless of whether they are tokens. e.g. KYC, AML
2. Specific Security Controls : These rules are specifically tied to the individual security offering itself. They might restrict who can invest based on their location, type (accredited, retail investor) , or impose limits on how much money can be invested within a certain timeframe.



Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a fundraising method for blockchain projects where a company sells new digital tokens to investors in exchange for cryptocurrency or fiat currency. The tokens can be used to access the project's future services, represent a stake in the project, or be resold for profit. 
A company develops a business idea and prepares a detailed document called a whitepaper. This document outlines the project, its goals, technical details, the problem it aims to solve, and how the issued tokens will be used within the ecosystem. Digital tokens are created using blockchain technology, usually on platforms like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana. The company defines the tokenomics, including the total supply, distribution plan, and any additional features (e.g., staking or governance rights). Some ICOs include a pre-sale phase where tokens are sold to select investors at a discounted rate. This phase helps generate initial funding and builds momentum for the main ICO event. During the ICO, tokens are sold to the public through the project’s website or other designated platforms. Investors send their funds (typically in cryptocurrency) to a specified address in exchange for tokens.
After the fundraising period, tokens are distributed to the investors, and they can either hold them or trade them on cryptocurrency exchanges if the tokens are listed.

Security Token Offering (STO)
A Security Token Offering (STO) is when a company gives out special tokens that show ownership of real or digital assets. STOs must follow rules from financial authorities. This gives them protection similar to traditional investments like stocks and bonds. Participation in STOs carries risks, including regulatory changes and the potential for loss of assets.
e.g. tZERO, a security token platform, conducted an STO in 2018 and gathered $134 million in resources. The platform aims to use blockchain technology to create a more efficient and transparent stock trading system.

STO regulation and law in UK
UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) treats a security token like any other regulated investment if it has features similar to traditional securities like shares or debt (security-like characteristics e.g., voting rights, profit share) .This means that anyone performing a regulated activity with that token, such as selling or arranging its sale, must be authorized by the FCA. Even if a token is not easily transferable, the FCA can still consider it a regulated investment.
Under current rules, an approved prospectus is necessary for any public offer or admission to a regulated market of a "transferable security". Howerver, there's still a number of exemptions which may be used to avoid being required to publish an approved prospectus.
The UK’s money laundering regulations do not to apply to a firm issuing its own shares and, therefore, should not apply to an issuer of share tokens in an STO. However, any other business involved in the Security Token Offering (STO) such as a crypto exchange, investment firm, or insurance providermust comply with the UK's money laundering rules. This is because these businesses are considered financial institutions.
If an individual transfers a security token, for example, by selling, exchanging, or gifting it, they are subject to Capital Gains Tax.
A new rules based on the OECD's Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) will require UK service providers to collect and report customer information to HMRC

# Day-4

## Regulatory Landscape of Cryptocurrencies
The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies varies significantly from country to country. Some countries have embraced cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, whereas some other have taken a more cautious approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. Countries which embraced blockchain and cryptocurrency adopts regulatory frameworks that promote innovation and investment in the sector. These countries typically have clear regulations governing the use of cryptocurrencies, including licensing requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges and anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations. However, countries which are more cautious with cryptocurrencies are concerns about the potential for misuse and financial instability. These countries may have stricter regulations in place, such as bans on cryptocurrency trading or restrictions on the use of cryptocurrencies for certain transactions. 
The varying regulatory approaches to cryptocurrencies can be attributed to different perspectives on the technology. Some regulators and policymakers view cryptocurrencies as a revolutionary technology that has the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems and drive innovation. These jurisdictions tend to have more favorable regulatory environments for cryptocurrencies, encouraging investment and development in the sector.
China, has banned cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs), citing concerns about financial risks and illegal activities. India has also proposed legislation to ban cryptocurrencies, although the final outcome remains. In the United States, the regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies varies at the federal and state levels. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken enforcement actions against ICOs that it considers to be securities offerings, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates cryptocurrencies as commodities. At the state level, some states have enacted laws to regulate cryptocurrencies, while others have taken a more hands-off approach.

## Regulatory Bodies for Financial Services
1. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) - US
2. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) - US
3. Federal Reserve - US
4. ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) - EU
5. MiCA Regulation - EU

6. FATF (Financial Action Task Force) - Global
7. IOSCO (International Organization of Securities Commissions) - Global
8. IMF (International Monetary Fund) - Global

9. Australian Securities and Investment COmmission (ASTC) - AU
10. Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) - AU
11. Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) - AU

13. Financil Conduct Authority (FCA) - UK
14. Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) - UK

## UK's Financial Regulatory framework
As security tokens are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) and the Regulated Activities Order (RAO). This means that we may need FCA authorization, and our offering could be subject to prospectus and disclosure requirements.
However, if we go with stablecoin, which value is backed by company reserves, it may fall under e-money regulations, requiring you to be licensed as an e-money institution.
Some of the core rules are:
⦁	All crypto businesses must register with the FCA and comply with AML and counter-terrorist financing regulations
⦁	If our token is a security, we may need to publish a prospectus and provide clear, non-misleading information to investors.
⦁	There are strict rules on marketing, especially to retail investors, and derivatives referencing crypto-assets are banned for retail sale.
⦁	We have to maintain ongoing compliance procedures for safeguarding assets, handling complaints, and preventing market abuse.

## Legal Strategy
For security token (A crypto backed by company) falls under security law in most jurisdictions (SEC, FCA, ASIC). We may need a license as a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) or equivalent depending on jurisdiction. AML/KYC obligations needs to applied on token issuance and wallet services. As our token will be used for payments, company will have to follow payment services regulation ( like e-money rules) as well.

## Corporate Structure
Legal Entity Type: Most issuers use corporations or LLCs for equity tokens, or SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles) for asset-backed tokens. SPV is required for tax-efficient jurisdiction to handle the actual issuance, sale, and distribution of the security tokens. This separation helps ensure that any regulatory issues with the token do not directly impact the core operating company.
For asset-backed tokens (like real estate or share), SPV is used to hold the underlying physical asset. The shares of this holding company are then tokenized, allowing the tokens to represent an indirect interest in the asset without requiring a physical transfer of title for every token trade.
Choosing a right jurisdiction with clear digital asset regulations (U.S./Switzerland/Singapore). Token-friendly jurisdictions reduce regulatory uncertainty.

## Asset-Backed Tokens
Asset-backed tokens are digital claims on a physical asset and are backed by that asset. Ownership of the token usually represents a right of ownership over the asset and, depending on the asset, may come with the expectation of future returns when the asset appreciates in value. As the asset itself appreciates in value, so does the token.

## Finding suitable blockchain network
Since we are aiming that our currency will be backed by the company's share and we are inteded for restaurant payments, Ethereum seems to be the most suitable for asset-backing project. We can use their exisiting mature token standards like ERC-1400 which is specifically designed for security tokens regulated assets (share). Or we can also use the most updated ERC-3649 as well. Using existing tokens gives the benefits of meeting compliance requirements, investor protections, and governance models. Since, their existing reputed ecosystem with strong developer supports makes their privacy stronger than building our own.  However, ehtereum's transaction fees can be relatively high which may cause lesser revenue for small scale business., especially if we compare with Polygon which has lower fees.
Polygon is a layer-2 solution (was built on top of ethereum base chain, i.e. scaling layer). It offers scalability + lower transaction cost, which makes it more suitable for our business. As we know, restaurants requires fast, cheaper transactions, both of these are achieveable by polygon's high thoughput. Polygon is not only compatible with ethereum, we can also share our token on ethereum for beter trust and compliance. 

## Security requirements for holding security tokens
KYC/AML: identity verification requires, like document checks, sancations/PEP screening, ongoing monitoring , and restrict transfers to verfied investors only.
Disclosure: Ongoing reporting and disclosure obligations are part of regulatory compliance regimes for security tokens
Transfer controls: allowlists/denylists, jurisdiction rules, lock-up periods, and suitability checks at the contract layer to prevent transfers to non-compliant addresses.
Emergency control: pausability for incidents, dispute resolution hooks, and controlled upgrade paths with transparent governance.

## Private Placement Memorendum (PPM)
PPM is a legal disclosure document needed to potential investors when a company offers securities (like shares or share‑backed tokens) in a private placement. It’s essentially the investor’s guidebook, explaining the opportunity, risks, and legal terms.
It protects the company by disclosing all material information, reducing liability, and ensuring compliance with securities laws.
It covers financials, business model, risks, management team, and terms of the offering.


# Day - 5

## Consensus Mechanisms

### Proof of Work (PoW)
PoW requires network participants called miners to solve computationally intensive cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. Miners compete to find a specific hash value by repeatedly calculating hash functions with different nonce values until they find one that meets the network’s difficulty requirements. The first miner to solve the puzzle broadcasts the solution to the network and receives a cryptocurrency reward.
Characteristics:
-	Energy-intensive computational competition, as it requires significant computational power and electricity 
-	Permissionless participation
-	Probabilistic finality requiring multiple block confirmations
-	Strong security against attacks when majority of hash power is honest, but vulnerable to 51% attacks if an entity controls majority hash power

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
PoS replaces computational work with economic stake. Here, validators are selected randomly or based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and “stake” as collateral. There are two main PoS variants: chain-based PoS where validators are selected periodically in a semi-random fashion, and BFT-based PoS using voting procedures. Validators are required to lock up (stake) a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral. 
If a validator acts dishonestly, two main consequences follow:
1.	Slashing of Staked Tokens: The malicious validator loses a portion or all of their staked tokens as a penalty (called "slashing"). 
2.	Removal from Validator Set: The validator may be barred or expelled from the network's active validator pool, meaning they lose the ability to participate in validation and earn rewards. 

Additionally, honest validators and other network nodes verify transactions and blocks. If they detect suspicious activity, they reject the invalid data, which prevents malicious blocks from being added to the blockchain

Characteristics:
-	Energy-efficient compared to PoW
-	Selection probability proportional to stake size
-	Validators can lose staked tokens for malicious behavior
-	Faster transaction confirmation times




### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

DPoS uses a voting system where token holders elect a limited number of delegates (typically 21-101) to validate transactions and produce blocks. These elected delegates take turns creating blocks in a scheduled rotation, enabling faster block times of 2-10 seconds. If a delegate acts maliciously, misses blocks, or performs poorly, voters can retract their votes and elect new delegates. Delegates also lock part of their stake which can be slashed if they behave badly.

Key characteristics:
-	Democratic election of validators
-	Higher throughput than basic PoS
-	Reduced decentralization due to limited validator set
-	Risk of vote buying and centralization

### Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
PBFT enables consensus in networks where up to one-third of nodes may behave maliciously. The protocol uses multiple rounds of message exchange and voting between designated roles (leaders and validators) to achieve deterministic finality. So, it can function correctly even if up to one-third of nodes are compromised or faulty. But, it requires extensive messaging among nodes each consensus round

Key characteristics:
-	Instant transaction finality
-	Requires known participant identities
-	Limited scalability due to quadratic message complexity
-	Strong consistency guarantees

### Proof of Authority (PoA)
PoA relies on pre-approved validators whose real-world identities and reputations are publicly known and staked. Validators are selected through a strict vetting process and must maintain their reputation to continue participating in consensus.

Key characteristics:
-	High transaction throughput and low latency
-	Reduced energy consumption
-	Centralized validator selection
-	Suitable primarily for private/consortium networks




## Tokenomics Models for business-share backed Coins

Tokenonomics is the systems that govern cryptocurrencies and digital tokens. It is the fundamental blueprint that outlines a project's financial structure and incentive mechanisms. It's crucial for a project's long-term sustainability and success. 

Key-components:
- **Token Supply**: The total number of tokens that will ever exist in our system.
  
  * Maximum supply: A fixed, hard cap on the total number of tokens which creates scarcity and can drive value. For example, bitcoin's 21 million limit.
  * Circulating Supply: The number of tokens currently available and actively traded in the market.
  * Total Supply: The total amount of tokens in existence, including locked or reserved tokens, minus any burned tokens.
  * Inflationary vs Deflationary Models: Some tokens have a continuously increasing supply which is called inflationary, like Dogecoin's unlimited supply. On the other hand some token use mechanisms like token burns to permanently remove tokens from circulation (deflationary), creating scarcity.


- **Token Distribution and Allocation**: Tokens are initially distributed among various stakeholders, such as the founding team, early investors, and the community. Transparent and fair distribution is vital for maintaining trust and preventing a few large holders from manipulating the market. Vesting schedules, which release allocated tokens over time, are often used to ensure long-term commitment.

- **Token Utility and Functionality**: A token must have practical use cases within its ecosystem to generate sustained demand.
  * Medium of Exchange: Used to pay for goods, services, or transaction fees on the network.
  * Governance: Grants holders the right to vote on important decisions, protocol upgrades, or the allocation of treasury funds within a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
  * Staking and Rewards: Users can lock up tokens to help secure the network and validate transactions in exchange for rewards, often in the form of newly minted tokens.



## General options for crypto integration:

- **Accepting Crypto Payments**: Customers can pay using Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins or tokens.
- **Crypto Loyalty Programs**: Reward customers with tokens or points that can be converted to crypto.
- **Crypto Gift Cards**: Allow customers to buy gift cards using crypto or redeem crypto for gift cards.
- **On-Chain Receipts & Transparency**: Store transaction records on blockchain for transparency.
- **Stablecoins**: Business can use stablecoins for less volatility.
- **Native tokens**: Businesses can issue their own tokens.

### Possible ways to integrate

- **Using a Crypto Payment Gateway:** Services like BitPay, Coinbase Commerce, NOWPayments, or Binance Pay. They handle conversion to fiat automatically if we don’t want to hold crypto. Integration is usually via API or plugins for POS systems.

- **POS System Integration**: Adding a crypto payment module in our POS system. If it doesn't support pluggin we can use a QR code system (customer scans and pays). Or we can also add a tablet or mobile app for crypto payments alongside your POS.

- **Wallet Setup**: Building our own wallet crypto-wallet (hardware wallet for security or custodial wallet via payment gateway). Depends on if we are going to hold crypto or convert to fiat immediately.

- **Compliance & Tax**: Local regulations for crypto transactions is still a concern. We have to ensure proper accounting for crypto payments (tax implications vary by country).


### Issuing Our Own Business Token

Businesses can create their own token for: 
- Payments (customers pay with your token).
- Loyalty & Rewards (earn tokens for purchases).
- Discounts & Perks (special offers for token holders)


#### Does holding the token make someone an owner?
If the token is legally backed by company's equity, then yes. Holders will have ownership rights similar to shareholders. Which means we are issuing a security token, not just a payment token and it falls under securities regulations in most jurisdictions. In that case, we will need proper legal compliance (KYC, inverstor agreement, ect.)


## Cryptocurrency key management

### Custodial vs Non-Custodial

**Custodial**: A third-party service (like Coinbase Commerce, BitPay) manages your keys. These are easy to setup, less technical complexity. But we have to **rely on the provider’s security** and we will have **less control** in this case.


**Non-Custodial**: Here, we will manage our own keys. We will have full control, no dependency on third parties. But the challenges will be the **higher responsibility for security**.




### Key Management Options

- **Hardware Wallets**: Devices like Ledger or Trezor store private keys offline. Best for cold storage or high-value funds. For POS we can use hardware wallets for settlement, but not practical for every transaction.

- **Software Wallets**: These are installed on POS or a dedicated device. For examples, MetaMask, Trust Wallet. However, If POS is compromised, keys can be stolen.

- **Multi-Signature Wallets**: This requires multiple keys to authorize a transaction. It may be good for businesses with multiple managers. Example: Gnosis Safe.

- **Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets**: It generates multiple addresses from a single seed phrase. It is useful for tracking payments per customer or per transaction.

- **Key Vault Services**: Enterprise-grade solutions like AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault. Store keys securely and integrate with POS via API.



		Caution: Never store private keys in plain text on POS. Use encrypted storage and secure enclaves if possible. Implement role-based access control. Regular backups of seed phrases in offline secure locations. Consider hot wallet for daily transactions + cold wallet for reserves.


#### Flow:
POS triggers payment → Customer sends crypto → POS verifies transaction using blockchain API → Funds go to business wallet (managed via one of the above methods).





# Day - 6

Their value fluctuates rapidly, so a $50 meal could cost 0.0008 BTC now and 0.0009 BTC in 10 minutes. On the other hand, Pegged to fiat (usually USD), so 1 USDT ≈ $1. With stablecoins, our revenue will be in USD terms, making bookkeeping and tax reporting easier. We don't have to constantly convert crypto to fiat for accurate records. Additionally, stablecoins on networks like Polygon, and BSC are lower in transaction fees (fractions of a cent) and faster confirmation times (seconds) compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum mainnet, which can be slow and expensive. 

On top of these, If we hold BTC/ETH, we are risking losing value overnight. Stablecoins will protect us from crypto market volatility. we can settle quickly into fiat if needed. These stable coins are easier for customers and our business as well, in order to calculate and settle payments without worrying about volatility. Customers know the value they’re paying (1 USDT = $1). They won't have the fear of paying $50 today and seeing it worth $40 tomorrow. 



## Fiat-Backed Stablecoins
Fiat-backed stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being backed by a reserve of a real-world fiat currency, like the U.S. dollar. For each stablecoin issued, the issuer holds an equivalent amount in the backing currency or other assets in reserve, such as cash or short-term government securities, ensuring the coin can be redeemed at a 1:1 value. For example: Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Binance USD (BUSD), TrueUSD(TUSD), PayPal USD (PYUSD). 

## Crypto-backed stablecoins
Cryptocurrencies like Ether are crypto-backed stablecoins. Ether uses smart contracts and is often over-collateralized to absorb the volatility of the underlying crypto assets.
Examples: DAI and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

## Commodity-backed stablecoins
Physical commodities like gold or oil. Here each stablecoin is backed by a specific amount of a real-world commodity, which is held in reserve. Example: PAX Gold and Tether Gold. 


## POS Payment System Integration

#### A. Payment Gateway Strategy
Design the Crypto Payment Gateway (CPG): We will need a middleware (the CPG) that translates the POS request into a blockchain transaction and back.

Key Functions are :

- Price Conversion: Real-time fiat-to-crypto exchange rates (USD to our token).

- Invoice Generation: crypto payment invoice creation (address and exact coin amount for a limited time).

- Transaction Monitoring: monitoring the blockchain for incoming payments to the generated address.

- Settlement/Accounting: Recording transaction details and handling conversion logic .

- Integration Method: deciding how the POS will communicate with our CPG (REST api or SDK?)

#### B. POS Software Integration
Building the necessary APIs/SDKs to allow our existing POS software to:

- Request an Invoice: Send the transaction amount (in fiat) to the CPG.

- Display Payment Information: Receive the crypto address and the exact amount (using QR/NFC) for the customer to scan and pay.

- Receive Confirmation: Get a real-time notification from the CPG that the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain (after a pre-defined number of block confirmations).

#### C. User Experience (UX) Design:

- Customer Flow: designing a simple and clean payment experience for the customer.

- Merchant Flow: Train staff and ensure the POS interface clearly indicates a successful or failed crypto payment.

- Handling Volatility: Implement a price lock feature (eg. for 5-10 minutes) to shield the merchant from price volatility during the transaction.

#### D. Legal, Compliance, and Security

- Regulatory Compliance: review regulatory requirements (e.g., KYC/AML) for issuing a coin and processing crypto payments. This is non-negotiable.

- Settlement/Taxation: set a clear accounting and taxation procedures for the crypto payments.

- Security: Implement security protocol for CPG (API keys, encryption, server security). Particularly, we have to ensure that the merchant's private keys are secured using industry best practices.

#### E. Final Testing and Launch
- Test edge cases
- Pilot Program: Launch the system with a small, internal group or a few selected merchant locations first.
- Monitoring: Set up continuous monitoring tools for transaction times, network health, and security alerts.


## Core Strategic Decisions
- **Blockchain Strategy**: The R&D concluded that a Utility Token built on an existing, high-speed, low-fee chain (like Polygon or Solana) is the best approach. This ensures the fastest time-to-market, leverages existing network security, and reduces development complexity.
- **Token Type**: The system must use a Utility Token (e.g., $PAY\_TOKEN$) for payment, rewards, and discounts. This is vital to avoid the complex and restrictive regulations (KYC/AML) associated with Security Tokens (equity/share-backed assets).
- **Volatility Risk Solution**: The R&D is centered on the Instant Fiat Conversion Model. This means the Crypto Payment Gateway (CPG) will automatically and instantly swap the received $PAY\_TOKEN$ for a stablecoin (like $USDC$) upon transaction confirmation, mitigating P&L exposure for the company and the merchants.
- **Equity Separation**: Any desire to build a share-backed token must be a completely separate project (an STO) that does not intersect with the retail POS payment method, to prevent every customer transaction from becoming a legally complex securities transaction.

## The Crypto Payment Gateway (CPG)
- **Price Quote**: The CPG uses an Oracle/Price Feed to get the real-time conversion rate from $PAY\_TOKEN$ to Fiat (e.g., USD). It then generates a unique payment invoice (in the token amount).
- **Instant Swap Logic**: This is the core function. Once the customer pays, the CPG immediately sends the tokens to a pre-funded Liquidity Pool (LP) on a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) to swap them for $USDC$.
- **Settlement**: The company settles the transaction with the restaurant in the stable $USDC$ (or fiat equivalent), minus the company's fee, thereby protecting the merchant from volatility.
- **Logging & Compliance**: The CPG must meticulously log four key values for every transaction: Fiat Invoice Value, Tokens Received, USDC Settled, and Transaction Cost, which is critical for tax and accounting audits.


## Business Benefits & Money Flow
The company's benefit is derived from controlling the economic flow, not from the token's value appreciation.

- **Financial Benefit**: The company captures the high margin between the low cost of the crypto rail (negligible gas fee, ≈$0.01) and the competitive processing fee charged to the merchant (e.g., 1.5% - 2%), which is significantly higher than traditional payment processors' net margins.

- **Customer Acquisition/Loyalty**: The primary distribution model for the token is "Spend-to-Earn" Rewards. When a customer pays at the POS, they are instantly rewarded a small percentage of the purchase value in PAY_TOKEN (e.g., 1% back). This creates a powerful loyalty loop where the tokens (which cost the company virtually nothing to mint) serve as a free marketing budget to incentivize repeat spending across the POS network.

- **Token Value Determination**: The value is initially fixed by the company (e.g., 1 token=$0.01), but quickly becomes market-driven by supply and demand on the DEX. The value is sustained by utility (discounts/access) and a deflationary mechanism (token burning).

## Determining the Price/Value of the Utility Token
Unlike a stock (valued by cash flow) or a stablecoin (valued by a fiat peg), a Utility Token's price is driven by two main factors: Utility Value and Market Dynamics
- **Initial Price Determination (Launching the Value)**: Since our token will have no market value at launch, we must set a fixed initial price to seed the ecosystem. This value is tied to the utility it provides.
  - Fixed Fiat Peg (Initial): We have to temporarily set a fixed conversion rate for internal use. For example, 1 $PAY\_TOKEN$ = $0.01 USD.
  - Utility-Based Valuation: We must then make this price meaningful by pegging it to a tangible discount or reward. Example: If 1 $PAY\_TOKEN$ = $0.01, we can offer a 5\% discount on a meal paid entirely with the token. A $10 meal costs 1,000 $PAY\_TOKEN$ instead of $10.
  - Exchange Equation: For the long-term valuation of payment tokens, we can use a model based on the Target Addressable Market (TAM) and Velocity. Economists use this formula in crypto to justify a payment token's value:$$MV = PQ$$
    - M (Money Supply): The circulating supply of our $PAY\_TOKEN$. (We will control this).
    - V (Velocity): How frequently the token changes hands (how often it's spent).
    - P (Price): The average price of goods/services (original value).
    - Q (Quantity): The total volume of transactions on our POS network (original value).
    - Here we have to focus on maximizing Q (total transaction volume) and minimizing V (encourage users to hold the token), which mathematically increases the sustainable value of $M$ (our token).
  
- **Post-Launch Price Discovery (The True Value)**: After setting the Liquidity Pool (LP) on a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) ($PAY\_TOKEN$/USDC), the market takes over. The price is then determined by Supply and Demand on that DEX. Our Crypto Payment Gateway (CPG) will pull the real-time market rate from the DEX's smart contract via an Oracle (like Chainlink or a direct API feed). Customers can check the rate on any public crypto tracking site (like CoinMarketCap) that aggregates the DEX price, and our POS screen will display the live conversion rate when they pay or redeem rewards.


## How to handle the value fluctuation?
- **The Price Lock Mechanism**: The fluctuation is only a risk during the few minutes the customer is completing the payment. Our payment gateway can solve this easily:
  - **Oracle Quote**: The customer scans the QR code for a $100 bill. The CPG instantly pulls the live market rate (for example, $1 \text{ token} = \$0.01$).
  - **Lock & Invoice**: The CPG locks the rate for a small window (let's say, for 5 minutes) and generates the invoice for 10,000 tokens.
  - **Instant Conversion**: The customer sends 10,000 tokens. The moment they arrive in our CPG wallet, the CPG automatically sells them for $100 $USDC$ on the DEX. The merchant and our company never hold the volatile $PAY\_TOKEN$ for longer than a few seconds. The value is locked and instantly settled in a stable asset ($USDC$ or fiat).

- However, the fluctuation is necessary to some extent for benefits. The token's fluctuation is what makes the whole incentive model work:
  - **Reward Value:** If the token price increases, the Spend-to-Earn reward we gave the customer becomes more valuable, making the loyalty program more attractive than fiat rewards.
  - **Liquidity:** If the price never moved, no one would trade it on the DEX. The price movement is what creates trading volume, which ensures liquidity for our CPG to perform its instant swaps.

## What about long-term volatility?
Our company have to actively manage long-term volatility and prevent extreme price swings through powerful Tokenomics Levers.
- **The Burning Mechanism Action (Deflationary Control)**: We will design the smart contract to permanently destroy (burn) a portion of the tokens collected as fees. As a result, this will constantly reduces the total supply of the token. According to supply and demand, reducing supply helps to cushion against price drops and drives long-term value appreciation.
- **The Buyback Program Action (Price Stabilization)**: On the other hand, our company can designate a portion of the fiat/stablecoin fees earned to buy back $PAY\_TOKEN$ from the open DEX market. When the token price dips low, buying it back provides immediate demand, which pushes the price up. The company can then use those purchased tokens for future rewards, effectively restocking its marketing budget.
- **The Ecosystem Lock-UpAction**: We can encourage users and merchants to stake or lock up their tokens to gain extra rewards or premium features. Locking tokens removes them from the actively circulating supply, which reduces selling pressure and helps stabilize the price.


## The Challenge of Dual-Purpose Tokens (Security and Payment)
When an asset is classified as a security, it is regulated primarily as an investment contract. These regulations are designed to protect investors, not to facilitate quick, everyday transactions.

- **KYC/AML Requirements on Every Transfer**: If our token is a security token, every time a customer uses it to pay for a meal at a restaurant, that transaction is legally considered a transfer of a security. Our smart contract is mandated to enforce KYC/AML checks on both the sender (the customer) and the recipient (the restaurant) for every single transfer.

  - **Impact**: A customer cannot simply use a burner wallet or an unverified address to pay. They would need a fully verified, regulated wallet, making the payment process slow, cumbersome, and impractical for a high-volume POS environment.

- The goal of a security token is to give investors a stake/profit derived from the company's efforts. The goal of a payment token (utility) is to be used to consume the product or service. Security tokens often have investor transfer restrictions (eg. only transferring to other accredited investors, lock-up periods). These restrictions are fundamentally incompatible with the fluid, open nature of a consumer payment system.


#### So, the practical solution is to builda  Pure Utility Token / Loyalty System
Since our goal is a wide-scale, frictionless payment method, we should focus on a pure Utility Token (or a loyalty token) for payment.

## Why should we not build our own network?
1. Developing a core chain takes huge time and super expensive, as we have to maintain the nodes.
2. Unnecessary Complexity for POS Transactions
3. A decentralized network's security comes from its number of independent validators/miners. If we start with only a few nodes our network will be centralized and vulnerable to a 51% attack.
4. In order to be listed on exchanges platform, we have to prove the security and liquidity—things which a brand-new chain lacks. Listing a coin on major exchanges (like Coinbase or Binance) requires deep security review, high liquidity, and often significant listing fees.
5. If consensus mechanism got any weakness it will completely destroy the network. 
6. Lacking developer community. Existing chains has large developer community who are constantly verifying security and contributing towards updating the chains.
7. Transaction mining will be expensive, as we have to manage the mining process at the beginning.
8. Layer solution is slow in transaction speed, which is one of the biggest drawbacks in POS system that requires instant transaction.
9. 24/7/365 maintenance is mandatory. We will become responsible for all network uptime, security patches, bug fixes, and hard forks.
10. If we use an existing L1 (like Ethereum, which has a market cap in the hundreds of billions), we inherit its battle-tested security. To attack a Layer 2 on Ethereum (token based solution), an attacker must first compromise Ethereum itself. On the other hand, if we create a new chain it will have no such external security shield.
11. Restaurants and customers will be hesitant to trust a brand-new, proprietary cryptocurrency network run by a single POS company compared to established, open-source networks.
