# Day (1-2)


## Identifying project requirement
1. To develop a new cryptocurrency system (a new currency which value will be backed by the company's share/valuation). [mining/initial coin offering].
2. A cryptocurrency wallet for transactions.
3. Outlining the technical framework objectives and implementation strategy in a whitepaper.
4. Enabling exchange with other coins/tokens.

## Identify the use case first
Based on the use case choose an appropritate blockchain platform
Consensus Mechanism selection (PoW/PoS/PoA) [Ethereum is moving from PoW to PoS]
Designing the internal blockchain architecture (Public/Private Network, Transaction Validation, Key Management, etc).
Develop the system.


## Should we choose Coin or Token?
Coin: (BTC, ETH, LTC) - Coin operates on independent blockchain (Blockchain, Ethereum). They function as a medium of exchange, stores value and pays gas cost to its own network. But the development process requries to build from scratch, a complex process (using languages like go, rust, c++, python). And the security is depends on own mechanisms-(PoW/PoS).
Token: There are mainly two types of token utility and security. Utility token is used for accessing services or products whereas security tokens represents ownership in an asset using smart contracts. 
Security token: Its value is related to the valuatoin of the company. Basically they are contracts representing the share of the company. Security tokens are required to follow federal rules. In security token system, assets are fractionalized into a number of tokens. Through tokenization, asset ownership is transferred to a blockchain and assigned a unique alphanumeric sequence generated by hasing algorithm.
e.g. company's valuation is $20 million, and if we create 500 million token, each token will worth $0.4 in value.
Security tokens requires conducting Security Token Offering (STO):
- SEC register
- Compliance
- Legal Works

## Risks in security token:
- Misappropriation of funds
- Security Breaches
- If value fluctuates, it might hamper user's trust

## Is there any alternative?
Probably Security toke with reward or loyalty service might work, or governance token for decision making or stable coins.

## RWA tokenization (security tokens):
- Asset valuation
- Legal framework [ownership rights, regulatory compliance, and legal entity that holds the asset]
- smart contract [platform, token standards]
- tokenizing an asset is basically converting its ownership rights into blockchain-based digital tokens that are legally and technically enforceable

So basically depending on the valuation of the company security tokens will be created. Each tokens value will rely on the company's share, valuation or any other means of value. In that case the company must be trasparent about their products/work/share/etc to build the trust among users. Allowing token exchage in wallet's or other platform may also help. So far, security tokens seems to be a good option despite some legal challenges. These security tokens are built on top of existing reputable blockchain with standard protocols (ERC20, ERC1400, etc.) rather than building our own cryptocurrency network and coin. This is primarily because the public blockchains are heavily tested on security and infrastracture of its host chain. This is more reliable than new unproven system as new chains are vulnerable to privacy risks. Also it will reduce the complexity, time, cost and security risks. Using an existing token standards will make it easier for token interchangeability. 


# Day-3

Choosing the right metodology:
Agile will be most suitable approach to manage the project. Instead of trying to build the entire project at once, we can work on the fundamental task first like building the token payment functionality, test it with a small user group, and then subsequently work on other task.

Initial Plan:
- Collecting general information: an overview of the project.
- Project goals and objectives. What is the expected outcome? What are we trying to build?
- Project boundaries (legal works, financial, feasibility of the project)
- Identifying potential risks to come up with the solution.
- What and how am I going to deliver my daily output?
- Are we going to use any project management tool, like Jira, Trello or kanban board for tracking workflow?
- What about strctured documentations. [Confluence, Document360]


Q: How to choose the optimal legal jurisdiction for your Security Token Offering (STO), as regulations vary globally.

Q: Security Token Offering (STO)
Q: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidelines
Q: Mint/Issuance of token ? [Pre-STO minting, As-needed minting]


The technical requirements for security tokens primarily involve the use of specialized smart contract standards that embed regulatory compliance rules directly into the code. Unlike basic tokens, security tokens must be programmable to ensure adherence to financial laws and investor protections across different jurisdictions.

Token Standards
ERC-20 - A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies.
ERC-721 - A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, like a deed for artwork or a song.
ERC-1155 - allows for more efficient trades and bundling of transactions – thus saving costs. This token standard allows for creating both utility tokens (such as $BNB or $BAT) and Non-Fungible Tokens like CryptoPunks.

ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Coments 20)
Token standard allows developers to build token applications that are interoperable with other products and servies. Token standards defines how tokens behave and interact across the Ethereum ecosystem. ERC-20 standard is used to provide additional funcionality to ether. ERC-20 uses Fungible Tokens (token against property where each token is exactly the same, both in terms of type and value, as another token. ERC-20 implements an API for tokens within Smart Contracts.
As of 06/20/2024 at least $83,656,418 worth of ERC-20 tokens were lost due to token reception issue. Note that a pure ERC-20 implementation is prone to this problem unless you implement a set of additional restrictions on top of the standard as listed below.
When ERC-20 tokens are sent to a smart contract that is not designed to handle ERC-20 tokens, those tokens can be permanently lost. This happens because the receiving contract does not have the functionality to recognize or respond to the incoming tokens, and there’s no mechanism in the ERC-20 standard to notify the receiving contract about the incoming tokens.
https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/

ERC-223
The main difference of ERC-223 with ERC-20 is that ERC-223 defines not only the token API but also the logic for transferring tokens from sender to recipient. It basically addresses some limitations of ERC-20 and introduces a new method of interaction between the token contract and a contract that may receive the tokens. Here, Recipients can detect that an ERC-223 token is being deposited. If a user sends ERC-223 tokens to a contract not supposed to receive tokens, the contract can reject the transaction, preventing token loss. ERC-223 tokens can include metadata, allowing arbitrary information to be attached to token transactions.
ERC-223 has it's own limitations:
- ERC-223 is not yet widely adopted, which may limit its compatibility with existing platforms
- ERC-223 is not backward compatible with ERC-20, existing ERC-20 contracts and tools will not work with ERC-223 tokens without modifications
- additional checks and functionalities in ERC-223 transfers may result in higher gas costs compared to ERC-20
https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-223/

ERC-1363
It's an extension interface for ERC-20 tokens. It supports executing custom logic on a recipient contract after transfers, or on a spender contract after approvals, all within a single transaction. It provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party, and then make a callback on the receiver or spender contract.


ERC-1400
ERC-1400 addresses the need for a standardized approach to issuing, managing, and transferring security tokens, while providing customizable regulatory enforcement, integrating global jurisdictional laws, and facilitating the incorporation of off-chain data into transactions for real-world validation and authorization. It allows for features like restricted transfers, partitioned balances, and the management of associated legal documents (off-chain validation of certificates)
ERC-1400 is a compelling solution for enterprises seeking to tokenize assets while ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and maintaining security. Its versatility and robust features make it suitable for various use cases within different industries. Some relevant use cases for ERC-1400 are: Tokenized Securities, Real estate tokenization, Asset-backed tokenization, Private equity tokens, Supply chain finance, Intellectual Property Rights, Tokenized Funds.

T-REX ERC-3643
The  tokenized securities, or security tokens cannot be permissionless tokens like utility tokens, which can be transferred to anyone. They must be permissioned tokens in order to track ownership and make sure that only eligible investors can hold tokens, in order to comply with securities laws such as KYC, AML. T-REX ensures that an investor cannot become a holder of any digital securities without fulfilling all compliance requirements. Also, regulators can audit these smart contracts to verify an issuer's compliance, contributing towards a secure, transparent, and efficient system for managing security tokens.  ERC3643 tokens maintain full compatibility with all ERC-20.
The management of compliant transactions through T-REX backed permissioned tokens depends on 4 main pillers which allow issuers  allow issuers to use a decentralized Validator to control transfers and enforce compliance on the holders of the security token:
- ONCHAINID : a blockchain based identity management system, allowing for the creation of a globally accessible identity for every stakeholder.
- A set of validation certificate (verifiable credentials) : emitted by trusted thrid parties and signed on-chain, each of them linked to a single ONCHAINED.
- An Eligibility Verification System (EVS): to filter transactions based on issuer rules, and compliance rules ensuring adherence to offering regulations.
- A set of Compliance Rules (e.g. offering rules): 
Two main types of control requriement associated with the issuance, holding, and transfer of security tokens:
1. General Regulatory Controls : Universal laws that apply to all securities, regardless of whether they are tokens. e.g. KYC, AML
2. Specific Security Controls : These rules are specifically tied to the individual security offering itself. They might restrict who can invest based on their location, type (accredited, retail investor) , or impose limits on how much money can be invested within a certain timeframe.



Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a fundraising method for blockchain projects where a company sells new digital tokens to investors in exchange for cryptocurrency or fiat currency. The tokens can be used to access the project's future services, represent a stake in the project, or be resold for profit. 
A company develops a business idea and prepares a detailed document called a whitepaper. This document outlines the project, its goals, technical details, the problem it aims to solve, and how the issued tokens will be used within the ecosystem. Digital tokens are created using blockchain technology, usually on platforms like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana. The company defines the tokenomics, including the total supply, distribution plan, and any additional features (e.g., staking or governance rights). Some ICOs include a pre-sale phase where tokens are sold to select investors at a discounted rate. This phase helps generate initial funding and builds momentum for the main ICO event. During the ICO, tokens are sold to the public through the project’s website or other designated platforms. Investors send their funds (typically in cryptocurrency) to a specified address in exchange for tokens.
After the fundraising period, tokens are distributed to the investors, and they can either hold them or trade them on cryptocurrency exchanges if the tokens are listed.

Security Token Offering (STO)
A Security Token Offering (STO) is when a company gives out special tokens that show ownership of real or digital assets. STOs must follow rules from financial authorities. This gives them protection similar to traditional investments like stocks and bonds. Participation in STOs carries risks, including regulatory changes and the potential for loss of assets.
e.g. tZERO, a security token platform, conducted an STO in 2018 and gathered $134 million in resources. The platform aims to use blockchain technology to create a more efficient and transparent stock trading system.

STO regulation and law in UK
UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) treats a security token like any other regulated investment if it has features similar to traditional securities like shares or debt (security-like characteristics e.g., voting rights, profit share) .This means that anyone performing a regulated activity with that token, such as selling or arranging its sale, must be authorized by the FCA. Even if a token is not easily transferable, the FCA can still consider it a regulated investment.
Under current rules, an approved prospectus is necessary for any public offer or admission to a regulated market of a "transferable security". Howerver, there's still a number of exemptions which may be used to avoid being required to publish an approved prospectus.
The UK’s money laundering regulations do not to apply to a firm issuing its own shares and, therefore, should not apply to an issuer of share tokens in an STO. However, any other business involved in the Security Token Offering (STO) such as a crypto exchange, investment firm, or insurance providermust comply with the UK's money laundering rules. This is because these businesses are considered financial institutions.
If an individual transfers a security token, for example, by selling, exchanging, or gifting it, they are subject to Capital Gains Tax.
A new rules based on the OECD's Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) will require UK service providers to collect and report customer information to HMRC

## Regulatory Landscape of Cryptocurrencies
The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies varies significantly from country to country. Some countries have embraced cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, whereas some other have taken a more cautious approach to regulating cryptocurrencies. Countries which embraced blockchain and cryptocurrency adopts regulatory frameworks that promote innovation and investment in the sector. These countries typically have clear regulations governing the use of cryptocurrencies, including licensing requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges and anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations. However, countries which are more cautious with cryptocurrencies are concerns about the potential for misuse and financial instability. These countries may have stricter regulations in place, such as bans on cryptocurrency trading or restrictions on the use of cryptocurrencies for certain transactions. 
The varying regulatory approaches to cryptocurrencies can be attributed to different perspectives on the technology. Some regulators and policymakers view cryptocurrencies as a revolutionary technology that has the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems and drive innovation. These jurisdictions tend to have more favorable regulatory environments for cryptocurrencies, encouraging investment and development in the sector.
China, has banned cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs), citing concerns about financial risks and illegal activities. India has also proposed legislation to ban cryptocurrencies, although the final outcome remains. In the United States, the regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies varies at the federal and state levels. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken enforcement actions against ICOs that it considers to be securities offerings, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates cryptocurrencies as commodities. At the state level, some states have enacted laws to regulate cryptocurrencies, while others have taken a more hands-off approach.

## Regulatory Bodies for Financial Services
1. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) - US
2. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) - US
3. Federal Reserve - US
4. ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) - EU
5. MiCA Regulation - EU

6. FATF (Financial Action Task Force) - Global
7. IOSCO (International Organization of Securities Commissions) - Global
8. IMF (International Monetary Fund) - Global

9. Australian Securities and Investment COmmission (ASTC) - AU
10. Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) - AU
11. Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) - AU

13. Financil Conduct Authority (FCA) - UK
14. Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) - UK

## UK's Financial Regulatory framework
As security tokens are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) under the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) and the Regulated Activities Order (RAO). This means that we may need FCA authorization, and our offering could be subject to prospectus and disclosure requirements.
However, if we go with stablecoin, which value is backed by company reserves, it may fall under e-money regulations, requiring you to be licensed as an e-money institution.
Some of the core rules are:
⦁	All crypto businesses must register with the FCA and comply with AML and counter-terrorist financing regulations
⦁	If our token is a security, we may need to publish a prospectus and provide clear, non-misleading information to investors.
⦁	There are strict rules on marketing, especially to retail investors, and derivatives referencing crypto-assets are banned for retail sale.
⦁	We have to maintain ongoing compliance procedures for safeguarding assets, handling complaints, and preventing market abuse.

## Legal Strategy
For security token (A crypto backed by company) falls under security law in most jurisdictions (SEC, FCA, ASIC). We may need a license as a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) or equivalent depending on jurisdiction. AML/KYC obligations needs to applied on token issuance and wallet services. As our token will be used for payments, company will have to follow payment services regulation ( like e-money rules) as well.

## Corporate Structure
Legal Entity Type: Most issuers use corporations or LLCs for equity tokens, or SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles) for asset-backed tokens. SPV is required for tax-efficient jurisdiction to handle the actual issuance, sale, and distribution of the security tokens. This separation helps ensure that any regulatory issues with the token do not directly impact the core operating company.
For asset-backed tokens (like real estate or share), SPV is used to hold the underlying physical asset. The shares of this holding company are then tokenized, allowing the tokens to represent an indirect interest in the asset without requiring a physical transfer of title for every token trade.
Choosing a right jurisdiction with clear digital asset regulations (U.S./Switzerland/Singapore). Token-friendly jurisdictions reduce regulatory uncertainty.

## Asset-Backed Tokens
Asset-backed tokens are digital claims on a physical asset and are backed by that asset. Ownership of the token usually represents a right of ownership over the asset and, depending on the asset, may come with the expectation of future returns when the asset appreciates in value. As the asset itself appreciates in value, so does the token.

## Finding suitable blockchain network
Since we are aiming that our currency will be backed by the company's share and we are inteded for restaurant payments, Ethereum seems to be the most suitable for asset-backing project. We can use their exisiting mature token standards like ERC-1400 which is specifically designed for security tokens regulated assets (share). Or we can also use the most updated ERC-3649 as well. Using existing tokens gives the benefits of meeting compliance requirements, investor protections, and governance models. Since, their existing reputed ecosystem with strong developer supports makes their privacy stronger than building our own.  However, ehtereum's transaction fees can be relatively high which may cause lesser revenue for small scale business., especially if we compare with Polygon which has lower fees.
Polygon is a layer-2 solution (was built on top of ethereum base chain, i.e. scaling layer). It offers scalability + lower transaction cost, which makes it more suitable for our business. As we know, restaurants requires fast, cheaper transactions, both of these are achieveable by polygon's high thoughput. Polygon is not only compatible with ethereum, we can also share our token on ethereum for beter trust and compliance. 

## Security requirements for holding security tokens
KYC/AML: identity verification requires, like document checks, sancations/PEP screening, ongoing monitoring , and restrict transfers to verfied investors only.
Disclosure: Ongoing reporting and disclosure obligations are part of regulatory compliance regimes for security tokens
Transfer controls: allowlists/denylists, jurisdiction rules, lock-up periods, and suitability checks at the contract layer to prevent transfers to non-compliant addresses.
Emergency control: pausability for incidents, dispute resolution hooks, and controlled upgrade paths with transparent governance.

## Private Placement Memorendum (PPM)
PPM is a legal disclosure document needed to potential investors when a company offers securities (like shares or share‑backed tokens) in a private placement. It’s essentially the investor’s guidebook, explaining the opportunity, risks, and legal terms.
It protects the company by disclosing all material information, reducing liability, and ensuring compliance with securities laws.
It covers financials, business model, risks, management team, and terms of the offering.
