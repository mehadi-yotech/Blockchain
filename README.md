# Day (1-2)


## Identifying project requirement
1. To develop a new cryptocurrency system (a new currency which value will be backed by the company's share/valuation). [mining/initial coin offering].
2. A cryptocurrency wallet for transactions.
3. Outlining the technical framework objectives and implementation strategy in a whitepaper.
4. Enabling exchange with other coins/tokens.

## Identify the use case first
Based on the use case choose an appropritate blockchain platform
Consensus Mechanism selection (PoW/PoS/PoA) [Ethereum is moving from PoW to PoS]
Designing the internal blockchain architecture (Public/Private Network, Transaction Validation, Key Management, etc).
Develop the system.


## Should we choose Coin or Token?
Coin: (BTC, ETH, LTC) - Coin operates on independent blockchain (Blockchain, Ethereum). They function as a medium of exchange, stores value and pays gas cost to its own network. But the development process requries to build from scratch, a complex process (using languages like go, rust, c++, python). And the security is depends on own mechanisms-(PoW/PoS).
Token: There are mainly two types of token utility and security. Utility token is used for accessing services or products whereas security tokens represents ownership in an asset using smart contracts. 
Security token: Its value is related to the valuatoin of the company. Basically they are contracts representing the share of the company. Security tokens are required to follow federal rules. In security token system, assets are fractionalized into a number of tokens. Through tokenization, asset ownership is transferred to a blockchain and assigned a unique alphanumeric sequence generated by hasing algorithm.
e.g. company's valuation is $20 million, and if we create 500 million token, each token will worth $0.4 in value.
Security tokens requires conducting Security Token Offering (STO):
- SEC register
- Compliance
- Legal Works

## Risks in security token:
- Misappropriation of funds
- Security Breaches
- If value fluctuates, it might hamper user's trust

## Is there any alternative?
Probably Security toke with reward or loyalty service might work, or governance token for decision making or stable coins.

## RWA tokenization (security tokens):
- Asset valuation
- Legal framework [ownership rights, regulatory compliance, and legal entity that holds the asset]
- smart contract [platform, token standards]
- tokenizing an asset is basically converting its ownership rights into blockchain-based digital tokens that are legally and technically enforceable

So basically depending on the valuation of the company security tokens will be created. Each tokens value will rely on the company's share, valuation or any other means of value. In that case the company must be trasparent about their products/work/share/etc to build the trust among users. Allowing token exchage in wallet's or other platform may also help. So far, security tokens seems to be a good option despite some legal challenges. These security tokens are built on top of existing reputable blockchain with standard protocols (ERC20, ERC1400, etc.) rather than building our own cryptocurrency network and coin. This is primarily because the public blockchains are heavily tested on security and infrastracture of its host chain. This is more reliable than new unproven system as new chains are vulnerable to privacy risks. Also it will reduce the complexity, time, cost and security risks. Using an existing token standards will make it easier for token interchangeability.
